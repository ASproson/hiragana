# Let's Learn Hiragana!

Hello there! This is a repo/web app I made to support people wanting to learn Hiragana. This is currently a work in progress but I'm looking to introduce the following features:

 - Study guide pages for revision
 - Set quiz page
 - Random quiz page
 - Live deployment

### Study Pages

These will be pages that list the hiragana, the english translation, and a pronounciation. You will be able to select which 'set' you want to study, or view the entire catalogue at once!

### Set Quiz Pages

These will be pre-defined quiz pages that I create based on my own learning needs, essentially they will be quizzes that test your ability to memorize both the hiragana, the translation, and the pronouncation of it. You will be presented a character set that is part of the same family, and they will be randomly shown to you. As you answer, your score is tracked on the page. I may include imagery to help with the memorization 

### Random Quiz Page

This page will be the end-game and will focus on provide the entire Hiragana for you to be quizzed on all at once. A random Hirgana will be shown and you will need to enter the right pronounciation/translation

### Live Deployment

I'd like to also eventually create a login and enable people to track their score over time. This is a stretch feature though!
